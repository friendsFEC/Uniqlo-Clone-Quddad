Front End Capstone Project for Team Friends

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` and to get dependencies.

Run the development server with `npm run client-dev`, and open browse to
`http://localhost:3000` to see the rendered app!

## Contributing Changes

For now, CSS files should go in `client/dist`, and all the front-end javascript
edits should be made in `client/src`. In the future, we'll be able to put CSS
files in `client/src` and have webpack bundle them :)
